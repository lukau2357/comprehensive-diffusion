This repository contains a comprehensive overview of diffusion models, starting from DDPM up to latent diffusion models, including all sub-components like VQ-VAE, VQ-GAN, CLIP, etc. It also provides scripts for interacting with Stable Diffusion 1.5, and visualizing the reverse diffusion process.

I did not add requirements in this repository, if you want to play arround with the code, I recommend cloning the notebook directly from Kaggle:
